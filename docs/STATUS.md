# STATUS — everything asked for, done vs not
### The honest ledger. Robert: "I need to find out what's not been completed. That's the most important thing." Last swept 2026-07-21 against the code + the two ground-truth audits this session.

**Legend:** ✅ SHIPPED · 🔨 PARTIAL (substrate exists, the ask isn't finished) · ❌ NOT DONE · 📋 DESIGNED (a spec is written, no code yet) · 🎯 DECISION (a call only Robert makes)

**Where it's tracked:** `BACKLOG` = a wave in `docs/MASTER-BACKLOG.md` · `#N` = GitHub issue · `PLAN` = a doc under `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## SCIENCE TACTICAL PASS — 2026-07-21

✅ **Shipped in the Science worktree:** ordinary missions now default to zero
armor for every actor; initial security is capped at seven with no more than two
responders and one dog; guard issue is pistol/SMG/melee only with military
ordnance removed. Direct sight begins an interruptible `SEARCHING` report rather
than an instant facility alarm; a successful report distributes one copied
last-known position and never refreshes it from the operator's live coordinates.
The HUD now reads `GHOST` → `SEARCHING` → `ALARMED`.

The deterministic Science operation graph compiles each authored building into
an insertion, critical objective route, extraction, closed patrol loops, report
nodes, and response routes. Guards actually walk those loops before contact,
then use the existing room search and return-to-duty behavior. The HUD/minimap
show floor-aware insertion, objective, report, and extraction markers; the Map
Maker draws the same critical/patrol/report/response graph and its metrics.

Civilian close combat now includes bare hands, baseball bats, katanas, and fire
axes. All four use the shared windup/arc/recovery brain: unarmed and bat deliver
force, katana delivers credited bleed, and axe pierces issued armor. Physical
weapons render in hand and drop as usable loot. Science K9s keep their shipped
stairs/no-doors/no-ladders building-clear behavior.

Insertion is quiet until the operator deliberately moves or attacks. Facility
guards never classify required Rescue researchers as hostile targets, preventing
the idle three-second mission failure found during the final browser playtest.

Verification: the operation graph passes a 100-seed matrix across all ten sites;
the insertion soak covers 30 generated seeds; TypeScript, the complete
160-file / 1,776-test Vitest suite, ESLint, and the production Vite build all
exit clean. The live Quick Deploy card launched Researcher Rescue and remained
`GHOST` with 8 clones and both researchers alive for the full eight-second idle
check.

## MOUNTAIN WARFARE — 2026-07-22

The overnight air+terrain campaign, gated and committed in six checkpoints.

**Terrain elevation v1 (`3344b9f`, `22bf332`).** The map gained optional
`height`/`ramp` layers and the `TERRAIN_U [0,4,16]u` band model (Ground /
Building / Sky). Vision reads it — high ground sees *over* a rise, a massif
*blocks* the line (`terrainTopAt`, `losClearTerrain`, threaded through
`perceivesNow`/`eyesSeePoint`). The renderer scales the wall+metal
InstancedMeshes to their tile height, so a mountain now READS as a mountain
from command height. **An absent height layer is flat and byte-identical —
every existing map and its tests are untouched.** (Owed: a live 3D screenshot
of Crown Divide in a real match; the relief is gate-proven, not yet shot.)

**Mountain procgen (`7083bcd`).** Crown Divide's massifs rise (Sky summit /
Building shoulder) — they cut sight across the ridge, cap rotorcraft, and let
only jets clear the peaks. Radar stations and supply caches seed on the carved
pass/valley routes as locations of interest.

**The new air program (`40ec6fe`, `1d2245d`, `df7e066`).** Four priced,
balanced, codexed airframes, each with its OWN silhouette: **Warhawk** gun jet
(A-10 school — straight wings, one huge AP cannon), **Specter** air-superiority
fighter (glass-cannon AAM reach), **Reaper** stealth bomber (the only airframe
radar can't lock past 42u — slips the SAMs to drop a precision stick), and the
**Hydra** guided-rocket attack heli (standoff volleys, single main rotor).
Seven new weapons; jets now HUNT each other (altitude-match + lead-fire pilot
AI) so the sky is contested. Distinct models proven on the new
`vehicle-sheet.html` motor-pool contact sheet.

**Winter reskin (`26cda37`).** Crown Divide is snowbound — a new `winter`
theme that mirrors the old europa theme's sim-affecting fields exactly
(gravity 9, grit surface, same sky menu), so play is byte-identical; only the
palette turns the ice-moon blue into bright snowpack under an overcast sky.
Also corrects a thematic mismatch (a mountain "divide" was on europa's
"ocean-floor domes"). The `amb_winter` bed slot is registered for the Sound
Editor to fill.

**Flat-large variant — Ashen Steppe (`generateSteppeTheater`).** The third
named terrain: a 900×900u open theater on the hardpan "Armor Country" theme,
**98.6% open** for long sightlines, with a few gentle walkable rises (the
terrain height layer, no Sky peaks) for observation, mirrored bases/LZs/supply,
and armor+jet pads. Lawful and reachable across the 10-seed sweep. The Map Maker
auto-lists it.

**The air-program spec of record is now `docs/AIR-PROGRAM.md`** — Robert's
authoritative 2026-07-22 design (the four airframes' target stats, procgen, and
pilot AI) with the honest BUILT-vs-REMAINING checklist. **No hard blockers**;
the four goal-critical mechanics now SHIP — rotorcraft Sky-gate (`46bfb16`),
heat-seeker AAM homing + guided multi-rocket (`1f97547`), and stealth
radar-track suppression (`9a2f7d1`). Remaining is polish: radar-site
counterplay + pilot-AI refinements (energy-fight, lock-break behind ridges,
heli hull-down). **Still owed** beyond that: **walkable elevation**
(infantry slope / vehicle ramp / cliff-climb — v1 massifs are impassable
masonry); the live 3D relief + snow + steppe screenshots. Plan:
`plans/2026-07-22-mountain-warfare.md`.

## THE ROAD TO ZERO — the resolution plan (added 2026-07-20)

The plan that resolves 100% of this ledger. Eight campaigns, dependency-ordered; each is a `/loop` diet of `docs/MASTER-BACKLOG.md` items with the gates + proof ritual baked in. **Run order matters** — early campaigns are substrate for later ones.

| # | Campaign | What it clears | Board items | Rough size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | **SIGHT** | the visibility rewrite: per-viewer bodies, hold-then-fade marks, the dark, house LOS, 3 bugs | W0.1-0.2, [#43-46](https://github.com/taskmasterpeace/ShootEm/issues) | 2-3 sessions |
| C2 | **UI P0** | every shipped-system-with-no-readout in `docs/UI-MASTER.md` P0 (hover bug, grenade pips, downed experience, missile lock, struggle, protection, LSW drop) | UI-MASTER §13,3,2,8,6,5,7 | 2-3 sessions |
| C3 | **COMBAT FEEL** | accuracy ladder + aim ring + falloff + spacebar verbs + ragdoll fix + tank rock + Impact Charge ring | W1.1-1.7, UI-MASTER §4 | 3-4 sessions |
| C4 | **STEEL + OUTBREAK Phase 1** | melee triangle (locked terms) + infection component + corpse lifecycle + fire/neutralization + Ball/AP/INC ammo + dropped weapons + ammo diagnostics→cut | W0.3/#47, 10.11, W2.4, 10.4, 10.5, W7.3 | 4-6 sessions |
| C5 | **THE DEATH SHOW + AIR** | death-cam director, gore, kill cam + aircraft crash, altitude legibility (sonic boom lands here), AA bands, drive-by, seat yield, rearm pads | W2.1-2.5, W5.1-5.6, 10.7, 10.8, UI-MASTER §8 | 4-5 sessions |
| C6 | **THE WAR** | time-skip deletion, 3×3 board, clone economy, pass escalation, military Operations, science missions v1, leaders, class-change, bots-as-robots, rank, press (AI paper + TV) | W3.1-3.10, W4.1-4.3 | 6-8 sessions |
| C7 | **THE SOLDIER + WORLD** | papercraft port (4 moves), SURF fold, slick ice, impact VFX, weapon-family holds, fire modes + brand mechanics + armed gods + beams/clash | W6, W7.1-7.4, 10.1, 10.2, 10.6 | 5-7 sessions |
| C8 | **PERF + NET + POLISH** | remaining audit issues [#2-#42] in board order (bench-tracked per fix), multiplayer staged stack, UI P1/P2 + all ✦ delights, memorable details W9 | 8.1-8.2, 10.10, W9, UI-MASTER P1-P2 | ongoing |

**The loop line:** `/loop` work `docs/MASTER-BACKLOG.md` campaign-by-campaign in the order above; per item: gates (tsc/vitest/lint/build) → on-screen proof in `docs/reference/` → bench-track if perf → check the box with the commit hash → update THIS ledger's row. A campaign is done when its every row here reads ✅.
**Standing rules:** decisions on the desk stay Robert's · no purple · marks are sidegrades · push on ask.

## THE SHORT LIST — what you asked for that is NOT done

If you read one thing, read this. Everything below has a full row further down.

**Combat feel:** ✅ **THE WHOLE §1 SECTION IS GREEN (2026-07-21)** — aim ring · accuracy-by-movement · ballistic falloff · tap-jump/hold-duck · tank hull wobble · ragdoll-threshold-everywhere (grass-conceal + duck-behind-cover already shipped).
**The death show:** a killer-facing kill-cam reward (replay is victim-only). *(DONE 2026-07-21: corpses lingering 20–30s both outbreak + non-outbreak · the death-cam director varies the shot by death — spawn-cut / the-wide / autopsy / ride-the-round / duel · gore/gibs on violent deaths.)*
**Sight (you just approved the fix):** 3D-shows-you / minimap-shows-team · darkness outside your cone. *(Fixed 2026-07-21: the three fog BUGS — fishbowl #43, corpses #44, vehicles #45 — plus upstairs-vs-upstairs house LOS and **contacts now hold-then-fade instead of blinking** on both the 3D view and the minimap.)*
**Melee:** STRIKE / GUARD / GRAPPLE + Impact Charge + the Control Struggle (terminology now LAW per the outbreak spec; the swing engine exists, wired only to zombie claws).
**The outbreak (new spec, §17):** infection/viral load ✅ · corpse lifecycle & reanimation ✅ · outbreak pressure/levels ✅ · emergent variants ✅ · ammo TYPES (Ball/AP/Incendiary) ✅ — all SHIPPED 2026-07-20, live in horde/survival/safehouse. Still design: zombies as a third faction mid-war · flashlight interiors · Bite Struggle · mixed magazines.
**The war:** the 3×3 board · the two faction leaders · bots looking like robots. *(Science Missions v1, time-skip deletion, clone economy, pass escalation, and class-change requests are shipped.)*
**Military Operations are shipped too:** six map-owned theaters, persistent manifests and stakes, direct-play exercises, and the per-map geometry runtime now sit beside Science Missions.
**The press:** AI-generated newspaper · the base TV newscast · the unnamed-soldier fiction.
**Air & armor:** six vehicle-scale biome theaters ✅ · Ground/Building/Sky/Clouds ✅ · **terrain elevation — mountains rise, block sight, cap rotorcraft, jets clear ✅ (2026-07-22)** · Shrike attack helicopter ✅ · Condor transport helicopter ✅ · Barracuda submarine/depth/sonar/torpedoes ✅ · scheduled radar/ECM/terrain masking ✅ · **the new air program — Warhawk gun jet · Specter fighter · Reaper stealth bomber · Hydra rocket heli, each its own model + jet-vs-jet AI ✅ (2026-07-22)** · **winter mountains ✅ · flat-large "Ashen Steppe" ✅ · guided rockets + heat-seeker AAM + stealth-radar-evasion + heli-Sky-gate ✅ (2026-07-22)** · PixelLab flight instruments ✅ · rearm pads + air-program polish (radar-site counterplay, pilot-AI refinements — see `AIR-PROGRAM.md`) remain.
**Weapons:** fire modes (single/auto/burst/**double-barrel**/pump) · per-family secondary fire · brand signature mechanics · and the Codex columns for all of it.
**Beams:** continuous/held beams · **beam-vs-beam clash** · beam birth effects · the seven beam types.
**Armed gods:** bow · spear · recall axe · summoners.
**Multiplayer:** the whole server/netcode stack (the sim is built for it; nothing is wired).
**Ammo:** diagnostics ✅. **The 25% cut is now MEASURED as a no-op** (bots burn ~15% of reserve per life, 0% go dry) — a real pistol-endgame needs a much deeper cut, now a 🎯 decision on the desk.
**Optimization:** 42 findings. **9 closed, all byte-identical** — prior: #1/#3/#5/#38; this pass: **#11 (encased O(S²), −30% horde), #10 (parked hulls, −33% veh-combat), #8 (roster cache), #9 (perception allocs), #27 (possession-scan gate)**. Cumulative **−37% at N=240 horde**, the superlinear O(S²) tail gone. Remaining wins are renderer/netcode, not the sim tick (`docs/OPTIMIZATION-AUDIT.md` § CLOSED).

## 1 · COMBAT FEEL

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| Aim ring orbiting the character, showing facing + accuracy bloom | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** A faint amber orbit ring + a two-arm WEDGE on the local player that points where you aim and OPENS with the live cone — it tightens crouched/still and sprays sprinting/airborne, reading out the accuracy-by-movement the sim applies. `renderer.ts` `aimRing`/`buildAimRing`; live-verified (neutral half-angle 0.15rad, faces aim, amber). BACKLOG W1.2 |
| Accuracy varies by movement (crouch/still/walk/sprint/airborne/vehicle) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** `aimSpreadMul` (world.ts) bends the weapon cone by stance at the fire site: crouch ×0.7 (braced), still/walking ×1 (neutral), sprint ×1.7, airborne ×2.1. `tests/aim-spread.test.ts` (6). Neutral kept ×1 so the threat-measure balance arena is untouched. Vehicle-mounted fire rides the separate turret-spread path (not stance-based). BACKLOG W1.1 |
| Ballistic falloff (bullets tire; lasers exempt) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** `ballisticFalloff` (world.ts) tapers a bullet/shell round's damage past `max(range·0.55, 42u)` down to `FALLOFF_FLOOR` (60%) at max range — energy weapons (rail/beam/plasma) exempt. Full damage inside 42u so close/mid fights (and the threat-measure arena) are untouched; only the long shot pays. `tests/falloff.test.ts` (5, incl. far-hit < near-hit). BACKLOG W1.4 |
| Tap space = jump, hold = duck | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** SPACE is a tap/hold for ground classes: a quick tap (<180ms) jumps on release, a longer hold ducks (no accidental hop, and no more bunny-hop from held-jump). Jetpack + ascended bodies keep space as held thrust/flight, duck stays on C. Pure `resolveSpace` (`input.ts`), `tests/space-input.test.ts` (3); live-verified (tap → y1.06 jump, hold → crouch). BACKLOG W1.3 |
| Ragdoll threshold applied at every knockback site | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** Extracted `maybeRagdoll(s, applied)` as the one shared gate (threshold, god/encased exemptions, extend-not-shorten, single event) and wired it into the **shockwave/Titan slam** (was shove-only) alongside `explode()` (mech stomp routes through explode). Self-movement (dash/roll/pad/lunge) and sustained force-fields deliberately excluded — impulse hits only. `tests/ragdoll.test.ts` (3). BACKLOG W1.5 |
| Tank hull wobble/settle on cannon fire | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** On the cannon's recoil signal the whole hull now PITCHES up and settles in a quick damped wobble (`env = e^-7t·cos(26t)`, ±0.09rad), on top of the existing barrel kick — tanks only, YXZ local pitch. `renderer.ts` (vehicle loop). Live-verified: pitch swings −0.046→−0.09rad under fire, flat at rest. BACKLOG W1.6 |
| Grass concealment (hide in tall grass, deeper when ducked) | ✅ | `perception.ts:95-101`, bots respect it |
| Duck behind cover / in grass | ✅ | crouch stance on C, sinks below grass line |

## 2 · THE DEATH SHOW

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| Death-cam **director** — different shot per death (bullet path / autopsy / wide / spawn-cut) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** `pickKillcamShot` (replay.ts) frames the death by HOW it happened — **SPAWN CUT** (brisk, cam 16), **THE WIDE** (a blast pulled back, cam 22), **AUTOPSY** (precision rail/beam from range, tight cam 12), **RIDE THE ROUND** (a long bullet, cam 15), or the straight **DUEL** — each with its own banner, camera pull, and tempo. `tests/killcam-shot.test.ts` (5); live-verified (spawn-cut + the-wide seen in a match). BACKLOG W2.1 |
| Deaths differ by weapon in the **animation** (fire collapse, laser drop-straight, melee spin) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** The ragdoll reads the killing weapon (`Soldier.lastKillWeapon`) → `collapseStyleFor`: a beam/rail drops you STRAIGHT (little tip, fast crumple), fire makes you WRITHE (thrashing limbs), a melee blow SPINS you down (yaw), else the default topple. `src/client/deathpose.ts` + `renderer.ts` collapse; `tests/deathpose.test.ts` (4); live-verified (rg2→straight, knife→spin, ar606→default). BACKLOG W2.2 |
| Gore / gibs on overkill + explosives | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** A VIOLENT death (splash weapon, or a ≥40-dmg overkill round) now throws chunky flesh GIBS (heavy, arcing, long-lived) + a wetter mist + a wider pool over the base splash, keyed off the death event's `weaponId`. Gated on `settings.blood` so reduced-gore players never see it. `renderer.ts` death case; live-verified: a GL death emits 29 particles vs a rifle's 12. BACKLOG W2.3 |
| Corpses linger 20–30s (a fought-on battlefield) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21, both mode families.** OUTBREAK: the reanimating `world.corpses` render + linger their incubation, thrashing before they rise (§1/§6). NON-OUTBREAK (tdm/ctf): a fallen body is booked on the alive→dead edge and lingers `BATTLEFIELD_CORPSE_LINGER` (24s) decoupled from the 4s respawn, then sinks away (`renderer.ts` `battlefieldCorpses`, live-verified in CTF). Client-side, no sim change. (Minor gap: non-viral deaths inside an active outbreak still clear at ~4s.) BACKLOG W2.4 |
| A **kill** cam — reward a great kill, not just the death | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W2.5).** Resolved as THE KILL CONFIRM — the killer's own flourish, never a screen takeover while he's alive and fighting: `✕ NAME · 47u` under the reticle (own element, the announce banner never blocked), a heavier confirm tick, streak `×n` spice, and a gold `— NEW LONGEST` when the trophy ledger moves (>20u). Sim emits `kill_confirm` addressed to the killer (humans only; zombie kills stay quiet). `tests/kill-confirm.test.ts` (3); live: `✕ DOZER2 · 47u — NEW LONGEST` in gold |
| Blood past armor, sparks off plate | ✅ | `bare` flag on hit events, `renderer.ts:3536` |

## 3 · SIGHT — the visibility rewrite (you approved this 2026-07-20)

Full spec: **`PLAN 2026-07-20-sight-and-steel.md` § A**. Measured: the game draws **8.70 enemies when you can personally see 4.84** — because vision is keyed by team, not by your eyes.

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| 3D view shows what **you** see; minimap shows what your **team** sees | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** The 3D soldier draw now rides a PER-VIEWER seen trail (`renderer.localSeen`) stamped by the LOCAL eye alone via `perceivesNow([local])` — same laws (cone+ring, skyline, smoke, grass, pings, muzzle reveal; the torch rides free); the minimap keeps the sim's TEAM trail (hud untouched). Hold-then-fade applies per-viewer; while DEAD the squad's radio paints (team fallback) so the death cam still frames the killer. Live-proven in-match: spotter's contact painted the minimap while the 3D hid it (`ROW_81_PROVEN: true`), turn-and-look draws it. [#46](https://github.com/taskmasterpeace/ShootEm/issues/46) W0.2 |
| Contacts **hold then fade** — never blink/pop out | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** 3D view: the ghost FREEZES at the lost-position and dissolves over the per-class linger (`renderer.ts` ghostAlpha, `tests/visibility.test.ts` "ghosts freeze"). Minimap: hostiles no longer pop off — each holds at its last-drawn spot and fades over the same `classLinger`, then prunes at `MAX_LINGER` (`hud.ts` `minimapContacts`). Live-verified via `window.__ww.hud`. (The separate 3D-vs-team-view split stays row above.) W0.2 |
| The world outside your cone goes **dark** | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21** (plan A2 steps 1+2+3+5). `src/client/darkness.ts`: analytic cone via `onBeforeCompile` — zero draws/passes/uploads, ~6 ALU/fragment; SHARED uniforms (one write reaches every material); cone = the SIM's `CONE_HALF`, the 9u `RING` stays lit, `uRange` = the same `perceiveRange` fog pins to (weather closes it free); soft smoothstep murk, never a laser line. Coverage: `mat()` at creation + an idempotent scene sweep every 90 frames (GLBs/drops/corpses ride the next pass); Basic mats exempt (instruments stay readable). Setting off/subtle/full (off = classic look exactly). `tests/darkness.test.ts` (5); live: brightness 73.5→61.1→53.6 ordered by setting, cone FOLLOWS yaw (turn around → murk swaps sides, ~35-48pt asym), 0 console errors. W0.2 |
| In a house/maze, see what you can see and no more | ✅ | **COMPLETE 2026-07-21** — the whole sight ladder: ground-floor LOS ✅; upstairs-vs-upstairs obeys the UPPER walls (A3 step 2, `losClearUpper`); and **the CROSS-FLOOR SLANT (A3 step 4)**: one end upstairs + one on the ground splits the line at the midpoint — the upstairs half marches UPPER walls, the ground half GROUND walls (`losCrossFloor`). Buys the ROOF-PEEK (ground clutter near the perch is seen OVER, from above and from below) and kills the FLOOR-PLAN GIVEAWAY (interior rooms keep their own walls — nobody reads the plan through the floor). END-anchored, not viewer-anchored — the same walls rule both looks. `tests/upperlos.test.ts` (8). W0.3 |
| **BUG:** any second storey is a fishbowl — seen through walls by the whole enemy team | ✅ | **FIXED 2026-07-21** (sight-plan A3 step 1): the skyline rule now guards on `(s.floor ?? 0) !== 1` — a jet or jump-trooper still skylines, but an UPSTAIRS body obeys cone+LOS. `perception.ts:94`, `tests/fishbowl.test.ts`. [#43](https://github.com/taskmasterpeace/ShootEm/issues/43) |
| **BUG:** enemy corpses bypass the fog entirely | ✅ | **FIXED 2026-07-21**: local play now culls enemy corpses live against friendly eyes, the exact rule `cullSnapshotFor` already enforced. Shared `eyesSeePoint` primitive. `renderer.ts` (soldier loop), `perception.ts`. [#44](https://github.com/taskmasterpeace/ShootEm/issues/44) |
| **BUG:** enemy vehicles are never fog-culled | ✅ | **FIXED 2026-07-21**: enemy hulls now obey the same fog (burrowed/ECM/LOS parity with the culler); live-verified — a tank with no friendly eyes on it draws `visible=false`. `renderer.ts` (vehicle loop), `tests/fogcull.test.ts`. [#45](https://github.com/taskmasterpeace/ShootEm/issues/45) |

## 4 · MELEE — STRIKE, GUARD, GRAPPLE

Implementation plan: **`PLAN 2026-07-20-sight-and-steel.md` § B** · **terminology and rules now LAW per `docs/OUTBREAK-SPEC.md` §12-16** (same triangle, locked words: GUARD beats STRIKE, STRIKE beats GRAPPLE, GRAPPLE beats GUARD; charged melee = **Impact Charge**; rear grab = **Rear Control** resolved by the **Control Struggle** best-of-three; vs zombies = **Bite Struggle**). The surprise stands: the swing engine (windup, 90° arc, locked facing, stagger, lunge) **already ships** at `world.ts:2569-2619` — wired only to zombie claws.

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| A real melee weapon + a melee key | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: the universal `knife` (Combat Knife, 34 dmg, 2.2u reach) is on **F** for every soldier without a returning axe — no ammo, shambler on you, you still have an answer. `tests/melee.test.ts` STRIKE block (4) |
| STRIKE (interrupts grabs, deals damage) | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: the knife STRIKE drives the existing windup→90°-arc→stagger swing (`WEAPONS.knife` → `startMelee`); shares the fire clock (no knife-and-shoot in one beat). Grab-interrupt lands with GRAPPLE. [#47](https://github.com/taskmasterpeace/ShootEm/issues/47) |
| GUARD (frontal arc, beats strikes) | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: held **V** raises a brace over a 150° frontal cone — a facing STRIKE lands only 12% and PARRIES (staggers + shoves the attacker off his swing: GUARD beats STRIKE); a flank/rear blow slips past. Costs stamina (~10/s, pauses regen), slows to 0.45×, lowers your gun & knife. `melee_block` event; `tests/melee.test.ts` GUARD block (5). Loses to GRAPPLE next |
| GRAPPLE → Rear Control → Control Struggle (zone vs needle, best-of-three) | ✅ | **grab + pin + struggle SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: **Z** is a close grab that BYPASSES + drops a raised guard (*GRAPPLE beats GUARD*) and pins the target in a rooted hold; a target mid-STRIKE stuffs it (*STRIKE beats GRAPPLE*); the pinned body mashes MOVE to break early and rebounds on the grabber. `grabbed`/`grab_break` events, HUD BREAK-FREE meter, `tests/melee.test.ts` GRAPPLE block (6). **BITE STRUGGLE SHIPPED 2026-07-20** (§15.5): ~1 in 4 shamblers LATCH ON instead of clawing (`beginBiteStruggle`, id-picked so the seeded stream never shifts) — the grip gnaws Viral Load, failing to break in time is a full bite (damage + infection), mashing MOVE escapes, and a broken clinch grants brief re-grab immunity; sprinters clamp briefly, brutes clamp longer; gods/ascendants shrug it off; HUD banner reads **BITE STRUGGLE**. `tests/melee.test.ts` (7). **REAR TAKEDOWN SHIPPED 2026-07-21** (§14.2): once you hold a rear pin, a SECOND Z commits the finisher — a heavy armour-piercing EXECUTION (overkill, so the body drops for good instead of crawling; credited as a knife kill → the melee-spin collapse). The pin's recover delay gives the victim a struggle window; gods are exempt (`maybeRagdoll`-style gate); `takedown` event; `world.maybeGrab`/grapple block, `tests/takedown.test.ts` (2). **CONTROL STRUGGLE SHIPPED 2026-07-21** (§15): a REAR pin on a PERSON opens the needle-vs-zone best-of-three — the Break Needle is a pure clock function (`ctrlNeedlePos`, sim and HUD judge the SAME needle), the attacker steers the Control Zone (A/D), the defender confirms Z inside it; a miss or a dead round clock hands the attacker the pip. Defender takes 2 → fights free with the full rebound + immunity; attacker takes 2 → the hold **LOCKS** and only then does the §14.2 finisher land (mash is dead on rear pins — Robert: 'more consequential when you grab them from behind'). Front pins keep the whole classic law. Bot defenders read the needle with seeded reflexes. HUD Contest Track (zone/needle/pips/clock) on BOTH sides; `struggle_start`/`struggle_round`/`struggle_lock` events; `tests/ctrlstruggle.test.ts` (5). Live: needle sweeps the track, in-zone Z scored def, two defs broke free with immunity. **OUTCOME MENU SHIPPED 2026-07-21** (§14.2, first tier): a LOCKED hold offers **Z takedown · F DISARM (+shove) · E CHOKE** — the disarm rips the gun IN HIS HANDS onto the deck as real loot (sidearm law: never below one weapon) and shoves him clear alive; the choke is a 2.6s silent CAPTURE that puts him DOWN (bleed clock, medic-liftable, no kill credit), and PAIN interrupts it (shoot the choker, the squeeze breaks). All gated on the lock — an unresolved contest offers nothing. `disarm`/`choke_out` events, HUD menu line both sides, `tests/outcomes.test.ts` (3). Live: choke 0→capture clean, kuchler ripped to the deck + shove. **THROW SHIPPED 2026-07-21**: SPACE on the locked hold HEAVES the body along your facing — ballistic (arc + push 13), ragdolling where it lands, no damage and no strip (placement IS the payoff: into the horde, off the roof, out of cover); hold released with immunity, `grab_throw` event, the menu line reads all four verbs. Live: push 12/arc 3.8/2.6u carry/alive. **HUMAN SHIELD SHIPPED 2026-07-21** (§14.2, the menu's LAST living verb): a locked hold with NO finisher chosen makes the captive your COVER — welded to your front (1.0u ahead), you advance (WASD) with him ahead, and frontal fire aimed at YOU redirects into him (rear/flank shots slip past onto you). Lasts as long as the pin; any menu verb ends it into that outcome; his death or a break ends it hard. HUD reads HUMAN SHIELD; `tests/outcomes.test.ts` (7). Live: welded 1.0u ahead, 5 frontal rounds → holder 100hp untouched, captive 100→25. **§14.2 outcome menu COMPLETE.** **[LATER 2026-07-21: the §15 needle CONTEST was REMOVED on Robert's order — 'eliminate the minigame.' A won rear grab now controls IMMEDIATELY; escape = mash (harder from behind, never lapses while held); breaking free KNOCKS the grabber back (anti-spam). Bite Struggle (§15.5) remains. The outcome menu, human shield, and pulse-ring UI all stand.]** [#47](https://github.com/taskmasterpeace/ShootEm/issues/47) |
| Impact Charge (wind-up → charged → maximum → overcharged, meter NEAR the action) | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: **hold F** winds up the knife STRIKE, release commits — bands 0-30% quick (×1) / 31-70% heavy (×1.6) / 71-100% MAXIMUM (×2.4) / overhold = FUMBLE (×1.2) + stamina bleed (`meleeCharge`/`meleeChargeMul`, `chargeMult()`); charge pauses regen, harder blows lunge further; HUD `⚔ IMPACT ▮▮▮▯▯` meter on the action line. `tests/melee.test.ts` Impact Charge (3). A tap is still an instant quick strike |
| See it — the swing animation reads | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21** — the audit note was stale; the W6.2 elbow branch closed the gap this session. Every attacker kind now reads: the ground **slash arc** fires for ANY melee shot (`renderer.ts` shot handler, `def.range <= 2.5` — the knife included), **zeds** climb-and-slash on the additive shoulder swing, **living soldiers** cock the forearm through the windup and SNAP on the strike (the elbow branch, `tests/elbow.test.ts` 3), **LSWs** play their own slam/thrust pose at windup. Plus the claw scrape audio telegraph. Live-verified when the elbow shipped |

## 5 · HUD

| Crew dots per seat + walk-up occupancy | ✅ | `hud.ts:209-226` |
| Tactical radar on the minimap | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-21.** Onboard fixed-wing/rotor/naval radar, submerged sonar, and staffed team sensors feed scheduled last-known tracks. The minimap draws rectangular-map-correct range rings, a cadence-driven sweep arm, air/ground/surface/submerged shapes, elevation letters, track fade, ECM uncertainty and damaged-sensor failure. `src/sim/radar.ts`, `src/sim/world.ts`, `src/client/hud.ts`; `tests/radar*.test.ts`, `tests/vehicle-instruments.test.ts` |

Standalone `/instruments.html` and Unified Harness `RDR Instruments` tab exercise eight states. |
| Right-click command wheel (order bots) | ❌ | RMB is alt-fire; no order path. BACKLOG (E1) |
| Rank insignia visible in match | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W3.9).** `#rank-chip` rides the in-match vitals row: insignia in the mono vocabulary (`rankInsignia` — Private wears the dot, enlisted chevrons ▴×1-6, senior NCO ◆+chevrons, officers ▮×1-5; all 14 distinct) + the rank name, amber glyphs on steel text, set from the dossier at boot. `tests/rank-insignia.test.ts` (3); live: `· PRIVATE` in the vitals row beside EN/viral |
| Altitude band readout when flying | ✅ | **SHIPPED (B2, row was stale).** The vehicle line reads `ALT ▁▂▅█ n/3` + the band-2/3 `— SAM-only sky` sanctuary reminder (`hud.ts` ~257). Live-verified in-match: `ALT ▅ 2/3 — SAM-only sky` |

| Afterburner · belly MG · missiles faster than planes | ✅ | J1, `world.ts:3502` |
| Dedicated military helicopters | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-21.** The Shrike attack helicopter carries rockets + cannon for support runs; the nine-seat Condor transport helicopter lands at insertion routes and becomes a comms-gated mobile spawn only while grounded. Both have procedural rotorcraft silhouettes and legal pads in every land/coastal vehicle theater. `tests/rotorcraft.test.ts`, `tests/rotorcraft-scenarios.test.ts` |
| Playable submarine warfare | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-21.** The Barracuda stages only in connected deep water, dives/surfaces on Q, follows deep patrol routes, disappears from enemy snapshots without staffed sonar, and while submerged can deal/take only torpedo damage. Named Barracudas are committable Operation hulls. `tests/submarine.test.ts`, `tests/submarine-scenarios.test.ts`, `tests/culling.test.ts` |
| Radar, sonar, ECM, weather and terrain masking | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-21.** Five deterministic emitter profiles sweep at 1.25–2.25s cadence and preserve serializable last-known tracks. Weather attenuates range; live ECM cuts reach to 65% and offsets returns; dead sensors stop sweeps; ordinary walls mask low ground radar, Mountain ridges mask air-to-ground radar, and sonar never resolves air. AI search consumes copied track positions, with sweep/contact/jam/reacquisition telemetry across 330 certified vehicle fights. `tests/radar.test.ts`, `tests/radar-world.test.ts`, `tests/vehicle-scenarios.test.ts`, `tests/rotorcraft-scenarios.test.ts`, `tests/submarine-scenarios.test.ts` |

| **Planes read as HIGH enough** | ✅ | **SHIPPED (B2 trio, row was stale):** the SHADOW ALTIMETER (`89e717c` — fixed-wing hulls cast a ground blob that grows+fades with altitude; the hovering Kestrel exempt by design), the CLOUD SHELF (`a0cbe12` — band 3 flies IN the clouds), and REAL ALTITUDE (`472d864` — sanctuary law + `BAND_ALT [0.12, 2.0, 8.6, 14.0]`: band 2 renders *above* the 8.15 rooftops, band 3 at 14). The old diagnosis (no shadow / no parallax / HIGH below rooftops) is fully answered |
| Aircraft can crash into terrain/buildings | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W5.1).** THE SKYLINE IS REAL: at band 1 (~2u) a hull that meets building fabric (walls/slits/doors/metal — `buildingAt`) takes speed-scaled damage (12 + spd×2.2, one scrape per 0.5s) and is REBUFFED, never ghosting through; band 2+ soars the sanctuary (BAND_ALT clears rooftops); deck keeps the taxi pass. Cover/climb sit under the low-flight deck. `tests/crash.test.ts` (2); live: band-1 jet into a wall hp 62→42, passed=false |
| Map wraparound for aircraft | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W5.2).** An AIRBORNE flyer (band ≥ 1) crossing the border comes out the far side — attack runs re-enter instead of grinding the fence; the deck and every ground hull keep the clamp. Seam distances don't wrap (a SAM reads the long way round — documented price). `tests/crash.test.ts` (+2); live: trail 140→144→**−149**→−142 (east fence → west sky) |
| Drive-by shooting (personal weapon from a seat) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W5.4).** A PASSENGER (seat > 0) fires his OWN gun from the seat — clip/rof/reload/§11 ammo riders via the shared `fireSoldierWeapon` + pool-aware `finishReload` (extracted, one law both paths); his own aim; slot switching works. The driver's hands stay on the wheel; mounted-gun seats unchanged; band-2+ airframes too high to lean out of; no knife lunges/charge rifles from a seat; friendly rounds can't bite the carrying hull. `tests/driveby.test.ts` (3); live: shotgun seat clip 30→24, rounds in flight, hull untouched |
| Cars handle like cars / handbrake | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W5.5).** The wheeled runabouts ride the slip dial: buggy 2.4 · bike 2.0 (slides furthest) · transport 3.4 (grip wins fast); momentum carries through a hard turn. **SPACE is the HANDBRAKE** (human drivers, slip hulls): rear grip breaks (lateral survives 3×), the nose whips (turn ×1.6), the engine drags (×0.5). Tracks stay on rails — a tank corners like a tank ON PURPOSE. `tests/handling.test.ts` (3), hoverboard suite updated to the new law (the board keeps its crown). Live: plain turn 0.445 rad vs handbrake 1.043 rad |
| Seat-yield (bot gives up its seat to a human) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W5.6).** A FULL hull makes room for a human — the rear-most bot steps out; the wheel yields LAST ("move over, I'm driving"); seated humans are never touched. `tests/seats.test.ts`; live: full buggy → bench bot yielded, bot driver kept the wheel |
| Diegetic per-hatch entry | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W5.6).** A human's seat follows the hatch they walked to: the NOSE takes the wheel, the TAIL takes a bench (the wheel from behind only when it's the last seat). Bots keep the classic first-free pick — a convoy needs drivers. `tests/seats.test.ts` (4); live: tail-hatch E → seat 1, wheel left open |

## 7 · THE WAR

Full law: **`docs/WAR.md`**. The ten-front campaign, clone economy, pass escalation, and the complete military Operations lane now ship; the 3×3 presentation, science lane, and remaining solo-war institutions do not.

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| Enlist once; 3×3 board (three fronts × three passes) | ❌ | ships as a flat ten-front campaign. BACKLOG W3.2 |
| Kill the time-skip (war only moves while you play) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W3.1).** `simulateTimeSkip` is DEAD (deleted, not bypassed) — boot now calls `holdTheLine`: after >1h away it writes ONE honest line ("the fronts HELD. The war only moves while you fight", `simulated:false` because it's TRUE) and touches no front. Your last map is exactly the map. `tests/campaign.test.ts` rewritten to pin the new law (a month away changes NOTHING); live: 48h rewind + reboot → the held line, fronts intact |
| Clones are the currency (per-front reserves, front lost at zero) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W3.3).** Every front carries a CLONE RESERVE (`400 × importance`); your side's deaths in a battle there SPEND it (`applyResult` gains `deaths` — main.ts passes the AAR's count); a win convoys +60 back (never past the seed); crossing 25% fires a `reserves CRITICAL` dispatch; **at ZERO the front is LOST outright** (control → −100, "the vats stand empty") whatever the scoreboard said. Armistice refills the theatre; old saves migrate to full vats (client + server loaders). `tests/campaign.test.ts` (+2); live: stripped-save boot → all 10 fronts seeded by the importance math, original save restored |
| Pass escalation (P1 no gods → P2 enemy gods → P3 both) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W3.4).** `FrontState.pass` (1-3): every battle digs the front one pass deeper with escalation dispatch lines ("their stable is awake" / "both stables are loose"); the armistice calms it back to P1. The gate lives at `requestLsw` — the ONE door every god walks through (human calls + the bot officer): P1 refuses both stables, P2 only team 1 answers (the war escalates AT you first), P3/absent = today's behavior (quick matches unaffected). Deploy passes the front's pass via `WorldOptions.lswPass`. `tests/pass-gate.test.ts` (3) + campaign advance test; live: P1 locked, P3 open, quick-match at pass 3 |
| **Science missions** | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-21 (W3.5).** Native offline mode with 10 verbs × 10 compact thin-wall sites, 1–8 finite clones, 0.25s field-printer reprints, last-clone failure, Ghost bonus, manual doors, guaranteed upstairs villa objective, Rescue captives, alarm/reinforcement scripts, convoy/LSW/storm/zombie complications, two windows per front/pass, 12 typed reward adapters, Scar bank, and Front Courier aftermath. `tests/science-*.test.ts` (80 focused checks); live-verified villa/quarantine/clone-vault. Friends-only co-op and the larger 50-effect consumer catalog remain later slices. |
| Player K9 building clear | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-21.** Eligible offline/Science players own the friendly dog. K/L3 SIC selects an aimed building authoritatively; L/R3 toggles Stay/Heel. Dogs detect hidden occupants only inside that building, use Ground/L2/L3 stairs, refuse ladders, doors, and glass, wait/bark for human-opened doors, sweep rooms, and confirm clear after two seconds. Replicated HUD/world markers show HEEL/STAY/CLEARING/WAITING. `tests/k9-orders.test.ts`, `tests/k9-building-clear.test.ts`, `tests/k9-controls.test.ts`, `tests/input-queue.test.ts`; live-verified CLEARING → WAITING · DOOR with zero browser errors. |
| **Military Operations — maps, skirmishes, missions, and persistent stakes** | ✅ | **SHIPPED 2026-07-21.** One deterministic window per front/pass; 15 verbs × 10 sites × 7 complications × 50 effects; six map-owned City/Desert/Countryside/Mountain/Coastal/Ocean theaters at 600–900u; Ground/Building/Sky/Clouds; named seasonal motor pool including Shrike, Condor, Pike, and Barracuda; treasury, manifest validation, staged objectives, hull losses, effects, HUD/AAR, records, Courier, and 330 deterministic vehicle fight probes. **Direct play now ships too:** one Military Missions card opens six curated local field exercises and launches every theater through the real Operation runtime without spending or changing campaign/service state. `docs/MILITARY-MISSIONS.md`; `docs/reference/vehicle-theaters/`. |
| Class change by request (leader AI rules on it) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W3.6).** A class is a POSTING: `ruleOnClassRequest` (src/sim/officer.ts, pure+deterministic) weighs the LIVE roster — infantry always signed, medics 1-per-5, one wrench per trench, recon capped, heavy 2-per-4 — and rules in the officer's voice ("REQUEST APPROVED — MEDIC. Keep them standing." / "DENIED — the line has medics enough. Hold your post."). Wired inside `redeployAs` (the death re-select rack): denial keeps your posting, the banner says why; re-clicking your current class is never a request. `tests/officer.test.ts` (4); live: the officer spoke on the banner in-match |
| Two authored faction leaders (voiced) | ❌ | no leader entity. BACKLOG W3.7 |
| Bots look like robots (chrome, subordinate) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W3.8).** `chromeBody` in `buildSoldier`: a bot body steels — color pulled to gunmetal, metalness ≥0.85, roughness ≤0.35 — same silhouette/rig/team tint. **The ANDROID law:** the UF face plate (exact skin tone) is exempt so faction identity (visual.test.ts, "UF shows a face") survives — their machines are androids: a human face on a chrome chassis. `tests/robot-look.test.ts` (3); live: bot avg metal 0.85 vs human 0.15 |
| Iron Eaters finished (weaver/ravager signatures, named, in Codex) | ✅ | **FINISHED 2026-07-21.** The two elders got their signatures: the **WEAVER** is the swarm's armorer (every 4s PULSES +14 plate onto iron within 8u — never itself, never past the forged cap; `weaver_mend` event; kill the weavers first or the scrap comes back hard) and the **RAVAGER** is the wrecker (a mark 6-14u ahead triggers the RUSH — 15u/s self-integrated, wall-checked — and contact SLAMS a 3u shockwave: 30 + shove vs flesh, 120 vs hulls it EATS; `ravage` event; 8s breath after). And every iron eater wears a **SERIAL DESIGNATION** — RAT-01, HOUND-02, LOOM-03, WRECK-04 — machine to the last (the killfeed reads like a scrapyard manifest). Codex THREATS ✅. `tests/iron.test.ts` (4). Engine truth learned: iron bodies move inside their own step — vel/push writes die unread |
| Underfunded-victory + morale banking | ✅ | B1, `world.ts:458` |

## 8 · THE PRESS

| Corrections box (the paper corrects itself) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W4.3).** Each edition runs ONE small retraction about the PREVIOUS issue — grounded in its actual data (the re-measured brag shot, the ace demanding +1, the quartermaster's "it remains impossible," the flip-flopping front, or the apology for finding no errors), picked by the stable hash so the same pair always prints the same line. `correctionLine` pure; hairline-rule italic box on the page. `tests/press-corrections.test.ts` (6); live: "ACE writes to claim 7 confirmed, not the 6 we printed…" |

| Papercraft body adopted into the game | ❌ | still only in the style lab. BACKLOG W6 |
| Named elbow joints (better strikes/holds) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W6.2).** The trooper's forearm pivots are named `elbowL`/`elbowR` and ride `JOINT_NAMES`; GLB bodies lack them and every pose skips gracefully (the quadruped-name contract). FIRST USE: the living STRIKE — the forearm COCKS back through the windup (+0.85) and SNAPS through on the hit (−1.05, easing home), absolute-from-rest so nothing accumulates; zeds keep their additive shoulder swing. `tests/elbow.test.ts` (3: names, rig-law geometry+pivot, bend-moves-hand-not-shoulder); live trace: cock +0.74 → snap −0.66 on a real knife swing |

## 10 · WEAPONS — the variation gap

You have 200 weapons with 200 stat lines and **one firing behavior**. That's the gap.

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| Fire modes: single / auto / burst-2/3 / **double-barrel** / charge / pump | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (10.1 slice 1).** `WeaponDef.fireMode` (absent = auto): single/pump fire on the trigger EDGE (one press one round; pump's action lives in its rof), burst-2/3 spend the whole n/rof cycle up front (round 1 on press, the RUNNER delivers the rest at 3× cadence), double fires BOTH barrels and pays 2/rof; charge pre-existed. **Every mode is DPS-NEUTRAL by construction** — feel changes, balance sheet doesn't; bots bypass trigger discipline (perfect taps), so threat-measure never moves. `tests/firemodes.test.ts` (5) |
| Double-barrel · auto-shotgun · two-round-burst rifle | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** Real guns via family disciplines carried through the arsenal generator: **Scatter Pack = THE DOUBLE-BARREL** (both barrels, one press), Shotgun+Slugger = pump, **Carbine = the two-round-burst rifle** ("a heck of an edge"), CAW-8 + SMG stay full-auto (THE auto-shotgun lives), P9 = single. Live: scatter press → clip −2, held → no spam |
| Per-family **secondary fire** | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (10.1 row 177).** The four proven alt kinds spread across the shooty core by family idiom (carried through the generator onto every variant): rifle+LMG+HMG = **burst** (flame burp) · carbine+laser = **tag** (recon dart) · SMG = **skitter** · sonic = **overcharge** (6 cells, one orb). Action guns (shotgun/slugger/scatter) + ordnance keep their hands full BY DESIGN — the pump/double IS their secondary. `altAmmo` seeds from the def at spawn. Live: carbine tag fired, smg skitter spawned, sonic paid its cells |
| Brand **signature mechanics** (not just stat curves) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (10.1 row 178).** Six manufacturers, six firing BEHAVIORS hooked at one measured site each: **maklov** TRUE ISSUE (−25% move-spread) · **kuchler** HOT HALF (back half of the mag cycles +10%) · **titan** CONCUSSIVE (a horizontal shove on rounds with no knockback) · **harkov** MATCH-GRADE (no ballistic falloff — the round carries) · **ceres** DEEP POCKETS (special pools pay −25%/reload) · **kamenel** HOT LOADS (+15% muzzle). Core class weapons carry NO brand → bots/threat-measure never feel it. `tests/brand-signatures.test.ts` (6); live: kamenel sonic muzzle 24.1 vs 21 (×1.15). Also hardened `spatial.add` against non-finite positions (seam sanitizer) + softened titan to horizontal-only after it perturbed a seed-pinned CTF match |
| Codex shows fire-mode + secondary columns | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** The Codex weapon sheet derives both live: `Fire mode` (sheet column — charge weapons read `charge`, absent = `auto`) + `Secondary` (detail/compare — the under-barrel kind where one exists). Live census across the armory: 12 double · 12 burst2 · 24 pump · 13 single · 231 auto · 4 charge. The Secondary column fills out as row 177 lands per-family alts |

## 11 · BEAMS

Ground-truthed this session. **Beams draw** (as fast box tracers); everything interactive is unbuilt.

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| Beams render | ✅ | `makeProjectile` case 'beam', `renderer.ts:3310` — a flying box, not a stream |
| **Continuous / held** beam (LSW only — soldiers never carry one) | ✅ | **THE HELD STREAM SHIPPED 2026-07-21**: `held` on a WeaponDef makes the trigger POUR — a per-tick chest-height ray walks the aim line to the first wall or body and pours dps·dt in (no projectiles, no clip); the governor is HEAT (sustain→JAM→cool, `beam_jam` event). LSW-only by test (`heldbeam.test.ts` sweeps WEAPONS: any `held` id must be `lsw_*`). Crimson's **Haemal Siphon** is the archetype — dps 100 = the old 10×10 (DPS-neutral), 4s pour / 2.5s jam. Renderer draws the LIVE stream (same walk, same endpoint the sim damages — what you see is what pours), shivering, sparking at the impact, dying on release. 5 tests; live: 75 poured before the bot FLED the beam, stream len tracked the walk, heat 0.25 after 1s, died on release. Other gods convert as rows 192/193 assign their styles |
| **Beam-vs-beam clash** (DBZ struggle, overpower, knock-off-aim) | ✅ | **THE CLASH SHIPPED 2026-07-21**: where two enemy HELD streams cross, a struggle NODE is born on the wielder axis and WALKS toward the weaker side — power = dps + SURGE (sprint held, 20 stamina/s, +40 power); reaching an end SHEARS through (loser's emitter knocked off-axis 1.5s + staggered, `beam_clash`/`beam_clash_break` events). Locked streams pour into each other — NEITHER damages bodies (the node eats both); stepping out dissolves without penalty; same-team never clash; projectiles never clash (only the rare held streams). Renderer: both streams draw INTO a white-hot throbbing node hemorrhaging sparks. `tests/beamclash.test.ts` (5: birth+no-body-damage, stalemate, surge→shear w/ events, free disengage, ally immunity). Live: clash formed, node drawn, clean dissolve (multi-second surge walks are unit-pinned — the visible pane's RAF interleaves real input into pump loops, memory law) |
| Beam **birth** effects (charge tell, muzzle bloom) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** The muzzle-spark exclusion for beams now runs a BLOOM instead of nothing: a 12-mote corona in the beam's OWN signature hue (`WEAPON_TINTS[weapon]` → the god's color → `TRACER_COLORS.beam`, same precedence as the projectile) around a 5-mote white-hot core. `renderer.ts` shot handler. Live: a beam shot emits 17 birth particles (was 0); the bullet baseline of 3 is untouched. (The pre-fire charge TELL for a windup beam belongs with the held-beam slice — beams fire at rof today, no windup event to hang it on.) |
| Beam **landing** effects, material-aware | ✅ | the hit handler already branches on tile/surface (`renderer.ts:3532`) |
| Seven beam types (Lance/Torrent/Tether/Sweep/Pulse/Siphon/Prism) | 🔨 | **4 of 7 LIVE 2026-07-21** on the held machinery: **SIPHON** = Crimson's Haemal Siphon (stops in the first body, drinks it); **LANCE** = Pulse's Resonance Projector (`held.pierce 3` — DRILLS through a file, each body drinks full dps·dt, walls still stop it; the drawn stream drills the same walk); **TORRENT** = Reactor's Feed-Beam (`held.catchR 1.6` — the flood catches 1.4u off-line where a tight beam misses). All DPS-neutral conversions; live: a file of two both at 67hp under one Lance pour. **TETHER** ≈ Venatrix's shipped harpoon (the reel — projectile form). **PRISM** = Magnetar's Induction Beam (`held.prism` — the first body becomes a NODE; the 2 nearest enemies in 10u with a clear line each drink 45%, walls deny the fan, nearest-first + id-tiebreak so sim and renderer pick the SAME fan; thin sub-rays drawn node→drinkers). Live: node 42 / flank 19 (the fraction), 1 sub-ray at the exact 7u gap, dies on release. REMAINING: Sweep + Pulse-throb styles (need carriers — future beam gods) |
| LSW production/landing effects (each god's beam looks distinct) | 🔨 | per-god tints exist; birth/impact/type flavor doesn't. BACKLOG (new) |

|---|---|---|
| Charged **leap** (hold-and-release with a direction; land loud, no air control) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** SPACE's third face: hold past the tap window WITH a direction = the duck is a COIL; release springs a ballistic arc (charge ramps 9→15 u/s over 0.9s of coil, `leapChargeOnRelease` pure in `input.ts`). Costs 25, shares the dash cooldown, NO air control (`s.leaping` gates the vel overwrite), and lands LOUD: `loudUntil` pings recon like gunfire + wakes dormant sprinters (§7.1). `tests/space-input.test.ts` (+4), `movement-verbs.test.ts` (+2), `sim.test.ts` (+1); live-verified (counter-steer 30 ticks → velX untouched; landing ping true) |
| Jetpack **commitment cost** (no regen airborne + a timeout after landing) | ✅ | full flight economy: burn-dry latch (relight at 35) + soft ceiling above 6u + ground-only regen + `JET_BREATHER` 1.0s post-landing pause (`world.ts` applyCmd; `tests/sim.test.ts` "landing is a COMMITMENT"). Gods exempt |
| Dive-roll / mantle / slide-off-sprint | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21** — all three verbs present. **SLIDE-OFF-SPRINT** (new): C while sprinting + moving drops you to a skid (`dash` verb 4) — long low burst (`SLIDE_IMPULSE` 19), cheaper than a dash (14 vs 25, spends sprint momentum), DUCKS you (crouch rides along → clears fire, ends behind cover); renderer back-lean skid. `tests/movement-verbs.test.ts`; live push 17.5/crouched/3u carry. **DIVE-ROLL** = the shipped dash (forward burst) + side roll (double-tap A/D). **MANTLE** = the running-jump vault: `blocksAir` deliberately doesn't block `T_COVER` above 0.9u, so a hop (apex ~1.06u) clears sandbags/crates — verified live (walk blocked at 2.9u, jump vaulted to 11u past the crate). **DRESS REFINED 2026-07-22 (C-1):** the slide now throws a BOOT-SKID DUST trail (reads on the ground, not just the spine-lean), and a regular trooper's **coil-leap LANDS WITH WEIGHT** — a dust ring + a 0.2s squash on touchdown, gated on a real fall (peak > 1.3u) so a stair-step never thuds (the weighty land-dress used to be LSW-leapers-only). `renderer.ts` movement dress; live-verified the slide dust. |

## 13 · LOOT & BODIES

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| Weapon shows on the body when you die; others pick it up | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** A dead human/bot drops its PRIMARY beside the body as a `type:'weapon'` pickup (gunmetal+glint mesh, bobbing): walk-over loads it into the special slot, a matching carried gun makes it an AMMO run; issue ar606 never drops, 20s despawn, 12-drop field cap, humans-only scavenge (threat-measure guard — bots drop but don't loot). Rides the snapshot free. Also fixed: consumed pickups' meshes never left the scene (supply-pod ghosts). `tests/loot.test.ts` (6); live-verified end-to-end |
| Bodies last longer (so loot reads as loot) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21** (`38aa67c`) — battlefield corpses linger 24s in tdm/ctf, outbreak corpses live their full incubation on-field (`491dab6`) |
| Lower ammo (**25%** reserve cut) so fights end in pistols | ❌🎯 | **MEASURED 2026-07-22 — a 25% cut is a NO-OP.** 90 sim-s of 12v12 TDM (2402 rounds fired): the average soldier burns only **~14.9% of their primary reserve per life, and 0% ever run dry** — they die long before the mag pool matters. Cutting to 75% still leaves ~5× the headroom they use, so nobody falls to a pistol. "Fights end in pistols" needs a FAR deeper cut (reserve to roughly **the ~20% band** a life actually spends) — **🎯 how aggressive is Robert's call.** BACKLOG (new) |
| Ammo **diagnostics** (rounds fired, reloads, dry-clicks, secondary time) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** Per-soldier counters in the sim (`statShots`/`statReloads`/`statDry` rate-limited/`statSecondaryT`, mortals only — claws never count) + per-weapon tally (`world.ammoShotsByWeapon`); `ammoReport` (blackbox.ts) rides `__ww.blackbox('report')` with humans split out. `tests/ammo-diag.test.ts` (5); live: 45 sim-s of war → 470 shots/19 reloads by weapon. **The 25% cut (row above) is now measurable — run real matches and read the box before cutting** |

## 14 · ARMED GODS

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| A god with a **bow** (charge-draw, arcing, pins bodies) | ❌📋 | designed. BACKLOG (new) |
| A god with a **spear** (thrown + tethered, recalled) | ❌📋 | designed. BACKLOG (new) |
| A god with a **recall axe** (boomerangs through the return path) | ❌📋 | the recall-weapon idea. BACKLOG (new) |
| A **summoner** (human squad) and a summoner (the horde) | ❌📋 | reuses the clone + Iron-Eater rosters. BACKLOG (new) |

## 15 · MULTIPLAYER

The sim was **built** for this (deterministic, seeded, headless, already serializes snapshots for the kill cam). The plan is in `docs/OPTIMIZATION-AUDIT.md` § THE NETCODE PLAN.

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| A server process (Node, same sim, 20 Hz) | ❌ | doesn't exist. OPT-AUDIT |
| Transport + input protocol (WebSockets, input-relay) | ❌ | OPT-AUDIT N-series |
| Determinism airtight (no drift) | 🔨 | deterministic by design; verification is a netcode-plan prerequisite. #20 |
| Client-reaches-into-sim cleanup | 🔨 | audited; several seams. OPT-AUDIT |
| Sessions / lobby / reconnect / late-join | ❌ | OPT-AUDIT |
| **Staged path:** co-op science missions first → full PvP second | 📋 | recommended in the netcode plan |

## 16 · WORLD / MATERIALS / ONBOARDING

| Ask | Status | Evidence / where |
|---|---|---|
| Trees | ✅ | procedural + GLB, forest regions |
| Materials: SURF fold (one movement source) | 🔨 | table exists; movement still on legacy tables. BACKLOG W7.1 |
| Ice is slick (momentum carry) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21** — the `slick` flag is live. On a slick floor (`materialForSurface(...).slick`, grounded) the boots don't BITE: velocity EASES toward intent on push-off (grip ~0.075/tick) and COASTS on release (~0.98/tick drag) instead of snapping — you skate, overshoot the corner, a shove sends you sliding. Ice-only; dirt/every other surface keeps the instant go/stop (player feel untouched). `tests/ice.test.ts` (4). Live: ice first-step 0.63 u/s vs dirt 8.4, glide 8.33, release coasts 3.1u while dirt stops dead. Pairs with row 246 (a frozen water tile becomes this surface). |
| Fire / burnable wood | 🔨 | **FIELD FIRE Phase 1 + 2a SHIPPED 2026-07-22.** `flammable` is CONSUMED: an incendiary round on flammable cover, or an incendiary grenade's splash, lights the ground (`world.fires`, tile-based). **Phase 2a — THE FLAMETHROWER LAYS FIRE:** a splashless flame STREAM (the F-3 Flamer, the AR-606 under-barrel burp — NOT the fireball-splash gods) now washes the flammable GROUND it sweeps low over, lighting a whole swept swath, not just incendiary rounds on cover (the projectile-step hook, `def.tracer === 'flame' && !def.splash && y < 2`). A burning tile scorches who stands in it (`FIRE_DPS`), SPREADS to its flammable orthogonal neighbours once (grass carries, metal/masonry don't), burns down over ~5.5s, and the renderer licks flame + smoke off each tile. Deterministic — no RNG, empty-early-out keeps fire-free replays byte-identical (the FULL 2243-test suite + a determinism trace green; no seed-pinned balance arena moved). `world.igniteTile/igniteAt/stepFires`; `tests/fire.test.ts` (8, incl. "the stream lit grass it never stood on" + a bare-ground no-op); live-verified on the savanna — a swept fire fan, proof `docs/reference/field-fire-flamer.png`. REMAINING: house/wood-frame **structural** burn-through (Phase 2b). BACKLOG W7.3 |
| Per-material impact VFX | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21 (W7.4).** A round meeting the world now answers in its MATERIAL'S voice, driven straight off the `materials.ts` `.impact` field (no more hardcoded metal/stone/dirt buckets): a structural tile speaks as its fabric, open ground as the surface you walk on. Eight distinct debris kinds — metal SPARKS + flash, masonry hangs DUST, stone CHIPS, **wood SPLINTERS** (pale, arcing), **water/mud SPLASH** (a crown that leaps + rains back), **ice SHATTERS** (bright shards + glint), **grass RUSTLES** (soft green), earthwork PUFFS. `renderer.ts` `spawnImpactFx(mat.impact, pos)`; the sandbag that used to "chip like stone" now correctly puffs. Audio maps to the 3 shipped impact sounds until the announcer kit adds wood/water/ice reports. `tests/impact-material.test.ts` (4, pinning the tile/surface→impact contract); live-verified in the running client (door→splinter, water→splash, ice→shatter, grass→rustle, 0 console errors) |
| Non-lethal training rounds | ✅ | `training` flag, the yard survives |
| Boot-camp prey bug (you're hunter both rounds) | ✅ | **FIXED 2026-07-21 (F.1).** `humansAndBots()` excludes `dummy` at the source — a range dummy is a target, never a roster entry. Fixes the yard's prey pick AND squad-wipe checks that dummies held "alive". `tests/dummy-roster.test.ts`; live: furniture absent from the roster |
| 3+ storey buildings | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** Indexed Ground/L2/L3 layers ship with backward-compatible Map Maker JSON; complete city buildings use automatic stairs plus deliberate ladders, floor-aware collision/perception/projectiles, renderer cutaways, and navigation validation. The Map Maker generates, edits, and previews all three storeys. `tests/map-layers.test.ts`, `tests/multifloor-combat.test.ts`, `tests/building-navigation.test.ts`, `tests/mapmaker-ui.test.ts`. |
| Water that freezes into a crossable surface | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21** — THE FROST BRIDGE: Frostbite freezes the water he stands near (`freezeWaterNear`, 7u radius, ~5s thaw) into a crossable sheet. A frozen tile stops being SWIM (you walk on top, not wade), drops the wade-drag (`waterMult`=1), and is SLICK (inherits row 240 — the skate). Lazy `frozenWater` map (tileIdx→thaw), re-stamped under the god so the ford lingers then melts; `water_froze` event + a per-tile pale ice sheet the renderer overlays. Only water takes; dry ground never freezes. `tests/frostbridge.test.ts` (5). Live: 50 tiles frozen + 50 sheets drawn, crossing carries 3.9u vs swimming's 2.1u, coasts on release. Pairs with row 240. |

## 17 · THE OUTBREAK — zombies as a systemic third faction (spec landed 2026-07-20)

Full spec: **`docs/OUTBREAK-SPEC.md`** (infection model, outbreak pressure/levels, corpse lifecycle, emergent variants, ammo types, melee UI, networking authority, 4-phase roadmap, acceptance criteria). Core promise: *the horde grows from casualties and contamination, not invisible spawn points.* Everything below is 📋 designed / ❌ unbuilt except where noted.

| System | Status | Substrate that already ships |
|---|---|---|
| Base Shambler + rare Sprinter as the production roster | ✅ | **ENFORCED 2026-07-21 (Robert: "remove special zombies… 1% sprinters").** `rollZedKind` (modes.ts) now spawns ONLY shamblers + a 1% sprinter — brute/bomber/stalker/spitter are GONE from the flesh horde (they still exist as entities: riseKind emergent-from-casualty + the iron race, untouched). Applies to horde/survival/safehouse (the shared roster). Live: a 5-min horde spawns `{zombie:1665, sprinter:7}` — 0 specials, 0.4% live sprinter share (1% spawn rate, diluted by reanimated shamblers). `tests/sim.test.ts` "the horde is SHAMBLERS + rare sprinters — NO special variants". **SPRINTER DORMANCY (§7.1, acceptance #18):** a sprinter spawns `dormant` — creeps at 3u/s and lies low until woken by PROXIMITY (7u), a clear LINE OF SIGHT (12u), or NOISE/gunfire (per-weapon report, opt §11.2), then sprints for good; `sprinter_wake` terror event |
| Shamblers at materially greater density (acceptance §21.17) | ✅ | **DENSER 2026-07-21.** Endless-horde `targetPop` raised base 8→12, per-intensity +3→+4, **cap 48→80** (elite ×1.35 → ~108), and the fill cadence quickened (1.6→1.4s floor, burst 1-3→1-5) — safe now that the O(S²) scan tail is gone (opt #11/#38). Live: a normal horde climbs 20→28→38→47→55… toward the 80 cap (was ~41→48). The bench proved ~790 shamblers inside the frame budget, so the headroom is real |
| Infection model (viralLoad, incubation, treatment; damage ≠ infection) | 🔨→ | **slices 1-2 SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: claws +22 / acid +14 (plate no defense); exposed soldiers INCUBATE (~1.4/s creep) and TURN at 100 — your own side rising against you; medic stim / heal beam are the CURE (walk it back); CLEAN→EXPOSED→INFECTED→CRITICAL HUD state ladder; `tests/infection.test.ts` (11). **LIVE in horde/survival/safehouse.** Resistance/strain families still design |
| Corpse lifecycle → reanimation (exposed body rises on a clock; blasts deny) | ✅ | **COMPLETE 2026-07-21**: a ≥40-viral death books a corpse that rises as a named shambler (hotter = faster); explosions / INC / BNR neutralize; `reanimated` event; **§6 CRITICAL window** — `corpse_critical` last-chance alert in the final 2s (acceptance #13). `tests/infection.test.ts`. **The incubating-body VISUAL ladder is in and live-verified**: the prone mesh stays hidden until the dead-soldier mesh clears (3.7s), then shivers subtly through incubation (0.015 amp) and CONVULSES in the final 2s (0.34 amp / ~25 Hz + ground-bounce) — live: crit rotation 0.288 rad, bounce 0.11u, hidden→revealed→twitch→thrash all read (`renderer.ts` corpse sweep) |
| Corpse burning / neutralization meter | 🔨 | **TWO paths live now.** Direct: an incendiary/BNR round near a corpse fills its `burn` meter → neutralized (§6.1, shipped 2026-07-20). FIELD: a corpse lying in **field fire** (W7.3, 2026-07-22) burns down to neutralized on its own — the incendiary→ground→fire→corpse fold Robert wanted. `tests/fire.test.ts` pins the field path. REMAINING: a visible per-corpse burn meter on the HUD |
| Outbreak Pressure + Levels 0-4 | 🔨 | **SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: `outbreakPressure` (live infected + unburned corpses×1.5 + exposed×0.5, eased) drives `outbreakLevel` 0-4 with a 3s confirmation window (§3.3); escalation announces; a color-climbing biohazard HUD chip. Sector-loss objective conversion still design |
| Third-faction outbreak DURING a human-vs-human front | ❌ | zombies are hardcoded team 1 — a true third faction needs the team model widened (the spec's biggest structural ask) |
| Clone infection tied to the reinforcement economy | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21** (unblocked by W3.3). `world.viralDeaths[team]` counts HOT deaths (the §6 corpse-booking site); the match-end fold bills the campaign vat DOUBLE for each — one clone for the reprint, one for the body that rose — with an AAR line ("☣ N turned — the vats paid double"). Live: hot death → tally 0→1 |
| Emergent variants from casualties (the body decides the form) | 🔨 | **SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: `riseKind(classId)` — a scout rises as a SPRINTER (lean), a heavy as a BRUTE, everyone else a base shambler; applies to both reanimated corpses and turned living. Armored/heavy-emergent full roster + mutation-field variants still design |
| Environmental mutation fields (readable causes) | 🔨 | **EMERGENT NESTS SHIPPED 2026-07-20 (§8/§3.1):** a body with ≥3 unburned neighbours within 6u anchors a contamination NEST (`world.nests`, rescanned ~1.5s) — infected inside run ×1.2 and a corpse rising in one rises MUTATED (×1.4 hp, "(mutated)"); nests raise outbreak pressure; `contamination` event = readable cause (too many bodies left to rot). `tests/infection.test.ts`. Facility-sourced fields (clone vat / reactor / foundry, §8 table) still design |
| Ammunition TYPES (Ball / AP / Incendiary launch; TRC/SUB/EXP/BNR later) | ✅ | **FULL ROSTER SHIPPED 2026-07-20**: B cycles all 7 — ball→AP→INC→TRC→SUB→EXP→BNR (`Soldier.ammoType`, deterministic on `PlayerCmd.cycleAmmo`, ballistic-only). AP threads plate −25%; INC burns corpses + ×1.6 vs ZedKind; **TRC** marks the struck target (psi-ping) − loud; **SUB** −20% dmg / −25% range (quiet); **EXP** ×1.5 vs bare flesh / ×0.65 vs armor·undead; **BNR** chemical corpse denial without fire at −40% dmg. HUD tags the loaded round; gods don't fumble ammo; `tests/ammo.test.ts` (8). Only **mixed magazines** (§11.3) remain design |
| Weapon HUD: ammo type, penetration, noise, fire hazard | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** The §11.2 fingerprint under the mag now reads the WEAPON, not just the ammo: `weaponProfile(def, ammo)` (`data.ts`) derives `ROLE · PEN NSE FIR COR` as 3-notch bars from what the gun actually does — a railgun `PEN▮▮▮`, a flamethrower `FIR▮▮▮ COR▮▮▮`, a tank cannon `NSE▮▮▮`, plasma the silent `NSE▯▯▯` — and it shows for EVERY offensive arm (was ballistic-only). **NOISE is a real sim distance:** `weaponNoiseRadius` (the muzzle report's reach) both drives the bar AND replaces the flat sprinter-wake radius in `bots.ts` — a service rifle carries exactly 18u (neutral-preserving, seeded matches byte-identical) while a cannon wakes the block and a silenced subsonic barely stirs it. The loaded round bends all three (AP→PEN▮▮▮, INC→FIR/COR▮▮▮, SUB→NSE▯▯▯). `tests/weapon-noise.test.ts` (9, incl. the gunfire-wake wiring); live-verified in the running client (7 weapons distinct, ammo riders move the bars, 0 console errors) |
| Interior flashlight (vision cone as a tool; wakes dormant sprinters) | ✅ | **DONE 2026-07-21.** T toggles the torch: the eye's CONE reaches `TORCH_MULT` (1.35×) further (`perception.ts` eyeSees — the RING/back-sensor untouched) and the darkness beam stretches by the same law (`renderer.ts` feeds `perceiveRange × TORCH_MULT` to the cone shader — one law, two surfaces). The PRICE: a lit torch is a beacon — dormant sprinters notice it at 2× sight radius (`bots.ts` wake). `tests/torch.test.ts` (3); live: range 65→87.8→65 through the real T toggle, 0 errors. `__ww.darkness()` debug handle added (eval-side imports get fresh module instances) |
| Networking authority for infection/grapples | 📋 | matches the netcode plan's server-authoritative model (OPT-AUDIT); grapple latency handling is new |
| Analytics for tuning (§19) | 🔨 | the blackbox ships and is the rail; ammo diagnostics already queued (10.5) |

**Sequencing note:** the spec's Phase 1 (Shambler+Sprinter, infection component, corpse timers, burning, Ball/AP/INC, the melee triangle) overlaps Wave 0.3 (#47), W2.4, W7.3, and 10.1/10.4/10.5 — build those as ONE campaign, not five.

## 18 · THE UI (master display inventory — audited 2026-07-20)

**`docs/UI-MASTER.md` is the one document**: every displayable state in the sim (a 100% sweep) × every shipped element in the client, with the visual treatment, the surface it lives on, and ✦ delight details throughout. Locked: near-the-action law, grenade **pip-refills**, **carrion birds** as the first animal, title **WAR WORLD: EARTH**.

**P0 execution (2026-07-20, C2 — all verified live):** ✅ the offline hover bug FIXED (tags + enemy rings work offline now) · ✅ grenade pips + cooldown sweep + the missing conc pouch · ✅ spawn-protection shell · ✅ MISSILE INBOUND warning + flares count · ✅ LSW drop countdown chip + tightening LZ dread ring · ✅ **THE DOWNED EXPERIENCE** (breathing DOWN banner + bleedout clock, pulsing amber rings under downed friendlies, the green revive arc that closes with the channel — proof: `docs/reference/ui-p0-downed.png`). **Still open in P0:** ✅ **the encased-struggle cracks (DONE 2026-07-21)** — the ice block IS the meter now: a jagged crack web rides the block and blooms with your `struggle` 0→1 (`renderer.ts` `updateIceBlock`/`makeIceCrackGeo`), the ice stressing brighter as it nears breaking, and the two drain-choice labels float over YOUR body — `MASH — BREAK −45` (amber) / `HOLD — BLEED 2.5/s` (steel), reading the sim's own `STRUGGLE_HP`/`ICE_HOLD_DRAIN` so they can't lie. `tests/encased-struggle.test.ts` (2, pinning both numbers); live-verified (clean load). ✅ **the charge-weapon ring (DONE 2026-07-21)** — the Impact Charge now reads ON the body too (UI-MASTER §4), not just the corner meter: a ring orbits you and TIGHTENS as it winds up (1.5u→1.0u), snaps to a bright amber MAXIMUM band (≥0.71), then a red OVERCHARGE pulse (≥1.3, the fumble zone) — the same bands the HUD meter reads (`renderer.ts` `chargeRing`). Only true P0 remnant is the SAM lock diamond, which needs a lock-on *mechanic* built first (deferred — no state to read yet).

## LOCKED DECISIONS (this session)

- **The title is WAR WORLD: EARTH** (Robert, 2026-07-20). The DSOA letterhead on the outbreak spec was the doc template's, not a rename.
- **UI law: near the action** — meters orbit the body/target/reticle; corners keep summaries. Grenade cooldown = **pip refills**. First new animal = **carrion birds** (the corpse-intel layer).
- **Sight:** 3D view = your eyes, minimap = team intel. Contacts **hold, then fade** — never blink out.
- **Science mission squad size:** scales **1 → 8** clones with difficulty (1 = knife-edge solo, 8 = forgiving assault).
- **Ammo cut:** **25%** on reserves — but the **diagnostics pass runs first** and validates it before it lands.
- **Beams:** LSW only. Soldiers never carry a continuous beam.
- **Repo:** push only when you ask (last sync 2026-07-20); commits stay local between asks.

**From the outbreak spec (§22.1 — these are LAW):**
- Clones can become infected. Outbreaks are **condition-driven**, never fixed-time; the infected can emerge as a third faction during active fronts.
- Shamblers are the horde's mass; **sprinters stay rare** (0.5–2%). Most variants emerge from casualties + environment, not rosters.
- **Fire is the primary corpse-denial mechanic.** Ball / AP / Incendiary are the launch ammunition trio.
- Melee is **STRIKE / GUARD / GRAPPLE**; rear grabs enter the **Control Struggle** (attacker's Control Zone vs defender's Break Needle, best-of-three); the horde's version is the **Bite Struggle**.

## STILL ON THE DECISION DESK (only you can answer)

- Which image API funds the AI newspaper (W4.1).
- Which three of the ten fronts survive into the 3×3 board (W3.2).
- Can you field a **captured** enemy god, or is that too big a swing? (science-mission reward)
- Science-mission stake: **permanent loss** on a failed run, or retry next window? (fear vs fairness)
- Leader names/personalities sign-off before they're voiced (W3.7).
- **How deep is the ammo cut?** Measured 2026-07-22: a 25% reserve cut changes nothing (soldiers use ~15% of reserve per life, 0% go dry). To make "fights end in pistols," reserve has to drop to roughly the ~20% band a life actually spends — a big swing. Confirm the target before it's cut, or leave the pool generous.

**From the outbreak spec (§22.2):**
- Does a perfect Break Hit give escape only, or an immediate **reversal** (defender takes control)?
- Can players **haul infected corpses into enemy territory** — and what anti-grief/war-crime rules apply?
- Who sees the exact incubation timer: everyone, or medics/recon only?
- Does incendiary ignite corpses reliably, or do armor/wetness make it genuinely uncertain?
- Do contaminated sectors **persist across sessions**, and for how long?
- Which rear-grab outcomes are allowed in PvP at launch (drag / disarm / human shield / choke / takedown / throw)?
- ~~The DSOA-vs-War-World title~~ **RESOLVED: WAR WORLD: EARTH** (see Locked Decisions).
